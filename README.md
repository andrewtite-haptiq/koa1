# Test KOA Server

To get this server started use `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode.

## Navigate Branches

I have tried to organize relevant code into branches.

The branches are as follows:

- **1-Basic-Server**

  This branch contains the basic server setup with a simple route.

- **2-Basic-Server-Error-Handling**

  This branch contains the basic server setup with a simple route and error handling.

- **3-Async-With-Koa**

  This branch contains the basic server setup with a simple route and error handling.
  It also contains an async route.

- **4-Cascading-Middleware**

  This branch contains the basic server setup with a simple route and error handling.
  It also contains an async route.
  It also contains cascading middleware.
